# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

- I created this Prework Study Guide Webpage as a resource and learning guide
- Creating this webpage has helped develop my skills in CSS, Git, HTML, and JavaScript. 
- By creating this Webpage I now have a simple template for CSS, HTML, Git, and JavaScript for any future projects!
- I have learned a lot including markdown functions, css layouts, adding and committing to branches on my GitHub repositories. I have also learned the importance of JavaScript including for loops, brackets to hold lines of code together, and how it builds a layout for our google chrome editor!

This webpage serves as a guide to easily view my notes on Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If I open the DevTools on this page I can see my JavaScript running. It lists all topics I have learned in prework and gives me the option of which one I would like to choose first.
